# ETHPOPreprod

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ETHPOPreprod is to recreate the ETHPOP population data using
the ETHPOP birth, death, inmigration and outmigration data. This is a
check for internal consistency and we will use the same approach to
extend for UK born and non-UK born individuals too.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ETHPOP-and-ETS/ETHPOPreprod")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(ETHPOPreprod)
## basic example code
```
